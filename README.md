# AlexaMindSherpa
Amazon Alexa Skill to explore Design Thinking process through decision tree

## Inspiration
Asking questions is a key to understanding Design Thinking and the process of how we make up our minds.  When Alexa asks questions we may be in the car or in the bathroom ... we have time to reflect on the questions and be reminded of them.  This Alexa skill is created in a story mode of a Sherpa leading you up the mountain to explore new ideas.  The metaphor of walking and climbing suggests reflection.  While you may read about Design Thinking, taking the time to go through the key points and the questions in a systematic way with as many repetitions as you may want is of great benefit.

## What it does
The skill explains the Design Thinking process and helps a person apply it.

## How I built it
The skill was built in part with the NodeJS Decision Tree design tool and other poetic coding.
